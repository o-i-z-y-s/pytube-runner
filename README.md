# pytube-runner
This is a Python script for downloading individual videos from YouTube. This project includes both a standalone EXE as well as the CLI version.

The EXE is packaged using [Auto Py To Exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe), which itself uses [Pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller), so a false positive in your antivirus is probable. This is a known issue and has been a known issue for a long time, due to malicious actors also using Pyinstaller to package their creations. Pyinstaller itself plays no malicious role, is open source, and is in use by over 55k users at the time of writing this.

*CLI version only*: The [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) project is the core of this script, so naturally pytube is required for it to function.

**NOTE:** There is currently a regex bug in pytube causing download failures. However, I have repaired the file responsible and included it in this repo, `cipher.py`. Replace your version of this file with the copy provided; you can find yours at `<Python directory)\Lib\site-packages\pytube>`. [The fix is described here](https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1293#issuecomment-1103362815).

## Why?
Typing out Pytube function calls in a CLI is tedious, especially when errors are a blackbox with this library.

This runner solves many issues:
- Chaining the parameters and download functions in one place for easy modification
- Asking the user to provide a video URL and clearly communicating most errors
- Prompting automated reinstallation of pytube if it encounters an AttributeError (*CLI version only.*)

## Default Settings
This script downloads progressive MP4 files in the highest resolution available, but only up to 720p. Once ripped, the videos are placed in a folder peer with the script file/EXE.

*CLI version only for now*: These settings can be changed in the file itself, as you may just want that crunchy 240p aesthetic, or maybe adaptive suits your needs better than progressive.

Check out [the pytube documentation](https://pytube.io/en/latest/) for descriptions of pytube's possible parameters and functions.

## Dependencies
*CLI version only.* The EXE version has no dependencies.
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)
- [customtkinter](https://github.com/tomschimansky/customtkinter)
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

The included batch file uses pip to install/reinstall pytube for you, which really only saves you one trip to your terminal, but it's a saved step nonetheless.

## Known Issues
These are not problems with this script, but rather issues upstream in Pytube itself.
- Playlists come in as empty.
- Whole channels similarly come in empty.
- Authenticating yourself to download Age Restricted videos is not working.
